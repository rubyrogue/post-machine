# Post Machine
A Postâ€“Turing machine is a "program formulation" of a type of Turing machine, comprising a variant of Emil Post's Turing-equivalent model of computation.

# How to run

First, you need to write your program using the language designed to run in this machine simulator, the language mp.
After this step you can save this file in the same folder as the Post Machine simulator file and run it as a whole project.

To run this project you'll need to compile the file Main.py and then type the name of the file you want to run in the machine simulator and the input word.

e.g.: Digite o nome do arquivo (Type the file name): `aabb.mp`
      Digite a palavra (Type the word): `"aabb"`
